# Continuous integration and continuous delivery.

## Continuous Delivery

[What is Continuous Delivery? - Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/)

- Software development methodology.
- **Release process is automated.**
- Every software change is **automatically** **built, tested, and deployed to production**.
- Before the final push to production, a person, an automated test, or a business rule **decides when the final push should occur**. (All changes needs to be validated before pushing to production).
- Although every successful software change can be immediately released to production with **continuous delivery**, **not all changes need to be released right away.**

## Continuous Integration

[What is Continuous Integration? - Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/)

- Is a software development practice.
- Members of a team use a **version control system** and **frequently integrate their work** to the same location, such as a main branch.
- Each change is **built** and **verified** to detect **integration errors** as quickly as possible.
- **Focused on automatically building and testing code.**
- As compared to **continuous delivery**, which **automates the entire software release process up to production**.
